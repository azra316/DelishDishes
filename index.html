                    <h2>Ingredients:For the Gulab Jamun</h2>
                    <ul class="Ingredientsbox">
                        <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                        <li>A pinch of baking soda</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or unsalted butter, melted</li>
                        <li>3-4 tablespoons milk (approximately)</li>
                        <li>Oil or ghee for deep frying</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>Add the melted ghee or butter to the dry ingredients and mix it in using your fingers. The mixture should resemble breadcrumbs.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add milk, a tablespoon at a time, and knead the mixture into a soft and smooth dough. Be careful not to over-knead it. The dough should be soft and pliable but not sticky.

                    </li>
                    <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the sugar syrup (Gulab). In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, crushed cardamom pods, and saffron (if using). Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes until the syrup slightly thickens. Stir in the rose water or rose essence. Turn off the heat and set the syrup aside.</li>
                    <li>After the resting time, divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls and roll them between your palms to make smooth, crack-free balls.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium heat. The oil/ghee should be moderately hot, not too high.</li>
                    <li>Carefully slide the prepared Gulab Jamun balls into the hot oil/ghee, frying them in batches. Fry them until they turn golden brown, stirring gently for even cooking. The Gulab Jamun will expand slightly in size while frying.</li>
                    <li>Once fried, remove the Gulab Jamun with a slotted spoon and drain excess oil/ghee by placing them on a paper towel.</li>
                    <li>While the Gulab Jamun is still warm, place them in the prepared sugar syrup (Gulab). Allow them to soak in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours before serving. The Gulab Jamun will absorb the syrup and become soft and delectable.</li>
                    <li>Gulab Jamun can be served warm or at room temperature. They taste great on their own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</li>

                        <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>

                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Prepare a square or rectangular pan by greasing it with a little ghee or lining it with parchment paper. Set it aside.</li>
                    <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter or ghee over medium-low heat.</li>
                    <li>Once the butter has melted, add the sweetened condensed milk to the pan and mix well.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the milk powder gradually, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.</li>
                    <li>Cook the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly to prevent sticking or burning, until it thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan. This should take about 8-10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped nuts, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using). Mix well to incorporate all the ingredients evenly.</li>
                    <li>Continue cooking the mixture for another 2-3 minutes until it thickens further and becomes a dough-like consistency.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared greased/lined pan, and spread it evenly using a spatula.</li>
                    <li>If using, gently press the edible silver leaf (varak) on top for a decorative touch.</li>
                    <li>Allow the Burfi to cool at room temperature for about 1-2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Once the Burfi has cooled and set, cut it into square or diamond shapes using a sharp knife.</li>
                    <li>Store the Burfi in an airtight container, and it will stay fresh for several days.</li>
